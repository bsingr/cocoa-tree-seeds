This project provides data for [cocoa-tree.github.io](http://cocoa-tree.github.io). Data is automatically collected and processed every 24 hours and pushed to [github.com/cocoa-tree/seeds](http://github.com/cocoa-tree/seeds).

The CocoaPods [Specs](http://github.com/cocoa-pods/Spec) repository acts as the main data source. For each CocoaPod hosted on GitHub additional information (e.g. about project activity) is fetched using the GitHub API.
